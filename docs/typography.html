### Typography
Capo takes your typography seriously. It defines a solid typographic scale and baseline grid, and ensures elements fall on it. Best of all, it makes good typography easy, with simple variables and mixins. You mark up you code semantically, and know the styles are right.

<h1 class="super-text">This is "super text"</h1>
# This is a top-level heading (h1)
## This is a second-level heading (h2)
### This is a third-level heading (h3)
#### This is a fourth-level heading (h4)
##### This is a fifth-level heading (h4)

<p class="breakout-text"> This is breakout (larger) text</p>

This is a normal, default paragraph.

<p class="sub-text"> This is sub-text.</p>

<small>This is the fine print</small>

# The details

Capo typography is based on a 10px baseline grid. All type measurements are determined by the baseline and are relative to it. Examples of various components and elements can be seen falling on the baseline grid on this page.

- Top-level headings (H1) are 4x the baseline grid.  
- Second-level headings (H2) are 3x the baseline grid.  
- Other elements are 2x the baseline grid.  
- Fine print is 75% of the baseline grid and set smaller than the default font size.  

# Choosing the correct tag

Do not choose tags based on the default size, choose them semantically. You can apply the mixin you need for visual style.
